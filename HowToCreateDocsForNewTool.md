For every new tool you should create documentation.

Such type documentation should not only contain the description of the tool configurations, but also how the tool itself works. For example, if we write documentation for the ESlint, we
should describe in the docs how data flows from one point to another one and what happens in each point. E.g. it should contain the descriptioin of the parser and the rules and how data goes
from parser to the rules. The description of the parser should contain how it works, why it's used, what possible options and why the particular parser is used. The same with rules and any another
point of the tool.

Also the architecture of the project itself should be documented. An example of how to do it can be found here: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute/architecture.
